# CLIP-Test-time-Counterattacks üöÄ
This is the official code of our work:

[CLIP is Strong Enough to Fight Back: Test-time Counterattacks towards Zero-shot Adversarial Robustness of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03613). Songlong Xing, Zhengyu Zhao, Nicu Sebe. To appear in CVPR 2025.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
### Environment
Make sure you have installed conda and use the following commands to get the env ready!
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate TTC
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Data preparation
Please download and unzip all the raw datasets into `./data`. It's okay to skip this step because torchvision.datasets will automatically download (most of) them if you don't already have them as you run the code.

## üì¨ Updates
 7 Mar 2025: **Please stay tuned for instructions to run the code!**
 
10 Mar 2025: **Updated Setup!**
